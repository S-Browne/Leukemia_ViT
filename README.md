# Leukemia_ViT
# This project uses VIsual Transformer technology to classify images of blood cells
# Much of the code used here is based on code found here: https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/vision-transformers-from-scratch-pytorch-a-step-by-step-guide-96c3313c2e0c
# ViT 1) is a basic implementation of the ViT architecture for 256x256 images
# ViT 2) is based on ViT 1), but now has 5-fold cross validation and data augmentation built in
# ViT 3) is for larger images containing multiple cells
